=== Create a new client

A client is always associated to a front office server, *FO-1* in the picture
below.

The creation of a new client will result in the generation of a JSON file on
the back office server (in the folder
``/var/lib/monarc/bo/MonarcAppBO/data/json/create/``).

The newly created JSON file contains the required information for the deployment
of the new MONARC instance.

The inventory of clients for the ansible playbook is kept up-to-date by
link:https://github.com/monarc-project/ansible-ubuntu/blob/master/playbook/update.sh[a script]
supposed to be launched periodically with cron.
The cron task should be run by a dedicated user (for example _ansible_) on the
configuration server.  +
As you can see the script ``update.sh`` checks for client(s) to create or to
delete on the back office through SSH. If needed, the ansible inventory is
updated. Then the ansible playbook is executed.


The creation of a new client will result in:

- the generation of an Apache Virtual Host with dedicated environment variables;
- the generation of a database for the client;
- the generation of a configuration file for MONARC
  (in ``/var/www/<client-alias>/``);
- the update of the reverse proxy (``/etc/apache2/client_redirection`` file);
- the update of the
  link:https://github.com/monarc-project/ansible-ubuntu/blob/master/playbook/monarcfo/templates/backup_db.j2[database backup script]
  on each front office servers.


=== Backup of client's databases

If you want to enable the database backup script:

[source,bash]
----
 $ mkdir -p /var/lib/mysql-backup/monarc/
 $ sudo crontab -l
# m h  dom mon dow   command
30 2 * * * /usr/local/bin/backup_monarc_db.sh
----

This script will backup the databases of each clients on the front office
server.

As explained previously this script is updated after each addition/deletion of
client(s).
