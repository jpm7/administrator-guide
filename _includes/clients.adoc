=== Create a new client

A client is always associated to a front office server, *FO-1* in the picture
below.

The creation of a new client will result in the generation of a JSON file on
the back office server (in the folder
``/var/lib/monarc/bo/MonarcAppBO/data/json/create/``).

The newly created JSON file contains the required information for the deployment
of the new MONARC instance.

The inventory of clients for the ansible playbook is kept up-to-date by
link:https://github.com/monarc-project/ansible-ubuntu/blob/master/playbook/update.sh[a script]
supposed to be launched periodically with cron.
The cron task should be run by a dedicated user (for example _ansible_) on the
configuration server.  +
As you can see the script ``update.sh`` checks for client(s) to create or to
delete on the back office through SSH. If needed, the ansible inventory is
updated. Then the ansible playbook is executed.


The creation of a new client will result in:

- the generation of a Apache Virtual Host;
- the generation of a database for the client;
- the generation of a MONARC configuration file
  (in ``/var/www/<client-alias>/``);
- the update of the reverse proxy (``/etc/apache2/client_redirection`` file).
